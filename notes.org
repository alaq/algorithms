* Notes
** Numbers
*** Modulo
*** Bitwise operators
    They deal with every level of the binary. Like 101 & 010 will be 000.
**** & is the Bitwise AND
**** | is the Bitwise OR
**** << shift one way
***** so we're moving the binary in tha direction. The ones leaving are just discarded.
***** it's akin to doing floor(half(x))
**** >> shift the other way
***** basically a double
**** ~ i.e. NOT
**** Reminder:
***** (1234).toString(2) or 1234..toString(2) to convert a decimal to binary
***** The other way around is done with parseInt('1001001011001', 2)
***** lon10 is what power to raise the base to get the value
